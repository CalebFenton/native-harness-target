# Native Harness Target

This is a demonstration app and native library harness.

**!! NOTE: This project isn't maintained. All efforts should be directed to [native-shim](https://github.com/rednaga/native-shim) !!**

Original idea inspired from Tim "diff" Strazzere's [native-shim](https://github.com/rednaga/native-shim).

Everything is explained here: [Calling JNI Functions with Java Object Arguments from the Command Line](https://calebfenton.github.io/2017/04/14/calling_jni_functions_with_java_object_arguments_from_the_command_line/)
